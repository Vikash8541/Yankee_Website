this is a order depended javascript so use it as follows:-

1> first link the waypoint js.

2> then link the counterup js.

3> add this data element to desired area.

and to initiate the counting use the following code in your custom js.

// jQuery counterUp
  $('[data-toggle="counter-up"]').counterUp({
    delay: 10,
    time: 1000
  });
